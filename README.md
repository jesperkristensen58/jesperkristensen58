I started my career in Research and Development, moved to Tech (the old Web2) for a while, and then worked as a Quant in finance.
Besides this, I have worked in the Web3 space for years and am a strong believer in its capabilities.

I hold a PhD in Physics from Cornell University with a minor in Computer Science and I love to learn, teach, and grow!

In my spare time I read and take long walks.
