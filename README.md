I started my career in Research and Development, moved to Tech (the old Web2) for a while, and then worked as a Quant in finance.
Besides this, I have worked in the Web3 space for years and am a strong believer in its capabilities.

I hold a PhD in Physics from Cornell University with a minor in Computer Science and I love to learn, teach, and grow!

In my spare time I read and take long walks.

Some recent books I read:

    - Security Tokens and Stablecoins Quick Start Guide: Learn how to build STO and stablecoin decentralized applications
    - The Metaverse: And How it Will Revolutionize Everything
    - Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions
    - The First 90 Days: Proven Strategies for Getting Up to Speed Faster and Smarter, Updated and Expanded
    - Options as a Strategic Investment: Fifth Edition
    - Option Volatility and Pricing: Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques, 2nd Edition
    - The Historical Atlas of New York City, Third Edition: A Visual Celebration of 400 Years of New York City's History

and more.
