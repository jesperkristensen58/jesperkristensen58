### üë®‚Äçüíªüë∑ About Me :

From an early age, I was captivated by computers and the burgeoning internet. Inspired by a family friend who was a software engineer‚Äîa rare and exciting profession at the time‚ÄîI delved into the world of technology.

My passion led me to build custom computers, optimizing performance by carefully selecting each component. I honed my programming skills, primarily focusing on website development. Gaming also played a significant role in my youth, with titles like Starcraft, Counter-Strike 1.5 (which I played semi-professionally), Red Alert, and Warcraft consuming much of my time. I frequented LAN events and internet cafes, immersing myself in the emerging digital culture.

My academic journey culminated in a Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Cornell, with a minor in Computer Science. This foundation launched a diverse career spanning Research and Development, full-stack engineering in Web2, and quantitative analysis in finance. As Head of Research at Advanced Blockchain, I led the company's research division, gaining valuable leadership experience and deepening my understanding of Web3. During this time, I authored a book and several award-winning articles.
Having missed the opportunity to participate in the early days of the internet due to my age, I see Web3 as a second chance to be at the forefront of a technological revolution. With over a year and a half of full-time experience in the Web3 space (and investments dating back to 2017), I'm committed to advancing its mission and potential.

In my spare time, I enjoy solving puzzles, reading to expand my knowledge, and taking long walks. Recent books I've read include:

- 'Security Tokens and Stablecoins Quick Start Guide'
- 'The Metaverse: And How it Will Revolutionize Everything'
- 'Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions'
- 'The First 90 Days'
- 'Options as a Strategic Investment'
- 'Option Volatility and Pricing'
- 'The Historical Atlas of New York City'

My journey from a computer-obsessed youth to a Web3 enthusiast and professional exemplifies my enduring passion for technology and its potential to reshape our world.

üëÄ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on projects in Web3, DeFi, and FinTech.
